# Snowplow E-commerce Package

Welcome to the model documentation site for the Snowplow e-commerce dbt package. The package contains is a fully incremental model, that transforms raw web event data generated by the [Snowplow JavaScript tracker](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/) using the e-commerce enrichments into a series of derived tables representing various e-commerce related data objects.

**For more information, including a QuickStart guide, operation and configuration, and implementing your own custom modules on top of this please visit the [Snowplow Docs](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/).**

*Note this model design doc site is linked to latest release of the package. If you are not using the latest release, [generate and serve](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/cmd-docs#dbt-docs-serve) the doc site locally for accurate documentation.*

## Overview

This model consists of a series of modules, each producing a table which serves to give a better understanding of website users' interactions with certain e-commerce actions. The 'standard' modules are:

- Base: Performs the incremental logic, outputting the table `snowplow_ecommerce_base_events_this_run` which contains a de-duped data set of all events required for the current run of the model, and is the foundation for all other models generated.
- Carts: Parses the cart interactions that occur to provide handy filters and aggregations, and outputs the `snowplow_ecommerce_cart_interactions` table.
- Checkouts: Parses checkout steps that occur to provide handy filters and aggregations to help identify which checkout steps were walked through, and what details were entered in each of these steps. This lends itself well to a funnel analysis. The Checkouts module outputs the `snowplow_ecommerce_checkout_interactions` table.
- Products: Parses product view and list information to provide insights into which products were being viewed, what details were being shown to the end user and how the user then interacted with these products. The Products module outputs the `snowplow_ecommerce_product_interactions` table.
- Transactions: Parses transaction actions to provide insights into which transactions occurred, how much revenue was generated from them, and other insights leveraging the many properties of the transaction e-commerce context. The Transactions module outputs the `snowplow_ecommerce_transaction_interactions` table.
- Sessions: Aggregates all other data into a sessions table which leverages the domain_sessionid, outputting the `snowplow_ecommerce_sessions` table.

Each module produces a table which acts as the input to the subsequent module (the `_this_run` tables), and updates a derived table - with the exception of the Base module, which takes atomic data as its input, and does not update a derived table.
