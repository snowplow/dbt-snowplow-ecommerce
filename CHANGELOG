snowplow-ecommerce 0.8.0 (2024-02-28)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release makes a few core changes to the sessions table. It stops non-ecommerce sessions being added to the derived table, and provides sensible defaults for numeric and boolean columns.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The sessions table now has sensible defaults (0 or false) for most numeric or boolean fields, even when that session did not have e.g. any cart events. Previously these were null.

## Fixes
- Fix issue where non-ecommerce sessions were showing in the sessions table. Note a full refresh is required to remove old sessions of this type.
- Fix an incorrect variable name in our package defaults

## Under the hood
- Simplified integration tests

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file. If you want to remove old sessions that shouldn't have been included, or populate nulls in the sessions table column, please do a [full refresh](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-operation/full-or-partial-refreshes/#complete-refresh-of-snowplow-package).

snowplow-ecommerce 0.6.0 (2024-01-05)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds the [base macro](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-utils-data-model/) approach to the core models of the package. This enables users to now specify custom fields for sessionization and user identification, to add custom entities/SDEs fields to the base events table for redshift/postgres, and to add passthrough fields to the derived tables so you can now more easily add your own fields to our tables. This release also contains other small enhancements and fixes to various tables. Note a full-refresh is not required unless you plan to change your identifiers, but you do need to run the statements in the [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/ecommerce/#upgrading-to-060).

## Breaking Changes
- This package now requires at least version 0.15.0 of `snowplow_utils`
- We now require at least version 1.5.0 of dbt
- Renamed columns in quarantined sessions and sessions lifecycle manifest table (please run the ALTER TABLE statements in the migration guide or do a full-refresh)

## Features
- Migrate base models to the new base macros for flexibility and consistency
- Add ability to add custom entity/self-describing event columns to the base_events_this_run table for Redshift/Postgres
- Add ability to use a custom session identifier and user identifier
- Add ability to pass fields through to derived page views, sessions, and user tables
- Add `ecommerce_action_type` and `ecommerce_action_name` to `product_intercations`
- Add `app_id` field to derived models

## Under the hood
- Aligned variables to follow the public docs

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file and follow the [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/ecommerce/#upgrading-to-060).

snowplow-ecommerce 0.5.3 (2023-10-04)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release fixes an issue for users using a utils version 0.15.1 or greater.

## Fixes
Fix error with new utils version on end hook.

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-ecommerce 0.5.3 (2023-09-12)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
Bumps the max supported `snowplow-utils` version to allow usage with our other packages.
## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-ecommerce 0.5.2 (2023-09-04)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version adds configuration properties to the `snowplow_ecommerce_incremental_manifest` and `snowplow_ecommerce_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest` that were missing (in particular `sort`, `dist`, `cluster_by`, `tblproperties`).

## Fixes
- Add sort, dist and cluster_by config to base_sessions_lifecycle manifest (close #34)

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-ecommerce 0.5.1 (2023-07-12)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version fixes a bug that may occur when duplicate events in Redshift/Postgres have different collector timestamps.

## Fixes
- Fix bug relating to duplicate filtering

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-ecommerce 0.5.0 (2023-06-27)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version adds the ability to model mobile e-commerce events alongside your web events. Note that the `domain_sessionid` and `page_view_id` fields prioritize the client session and screen view contexts respectively and are overwritten with those values even if they exist for the mobile event. This means no change to your derived tables. To enable this (assuming you are tracking e-commerce events on mobile and have those contexts in your events table), set `snowplow__enable_mobile_events` to `true` in your `dbt_project.yml`

We have also made a change to some id generation logic to fix a bug, which will require a full refresh to align your data.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
Due to a change in how we generate the product_event_id to allow for duplicate products in a product context, **you will need to do a full-refresh of your derived tables** to ensure old records have their key correctly updated. Without this, any records that get re-processed would end up as extra rows in the product/transaction table rather than overwriting their old versions.

## Features
- Support simultaneously modeling mobile e-commerce events

## Fixes
- Allow duplicate products in product context

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file, and run a full refresh of your data.

snowplow-ecommerce 0.4.2 (2023-05-05)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version fixes a bug for Snowflake / Databricks / Redshift users where a couple of decimal fields need to be changed to allow for the maximum values that could arrive based on the schema definitions.

## Features
- Fix small decimal fields

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
Existing users on Snowflake / Databricks / Redshift will need to make changes to some of their derived tables. For a full sql script on how to achieve this, check out the relevant [migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/ecommerce/) The other option is to do a [complete refresh](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-operation/#complete-refresh-of-snowplow-package) of the package.

snowplow-ecommerce 0.4.1 (2023-04-21)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version adds support for running the models on Redshift warehouses. Support for Postgres is also technically added, however the `snowplow_ecommerce_action` context cannot currently be tracked by default into Postgres due to table name length limits, so a custom version of the schema would have to be tracked against.

## Features
- Adds support for Redshift

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file

snowplow-ecommerce 0.4.0 (2023-03-29)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version migrates our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top. We've also introduced some new variables that can be used to disable unneeded modules while maintaining downstream functionality in the `sessions` table that is produced.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` :
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization
- Allow users to disable certain modules while still upholding downstream functionality through new variables

## Docs
- Update readme

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-ecommerce version in your `packages.yml` file, and ensuring you have followed the above steps. You can read more in our [upgrade guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/ecommerce/#upgrading-to-0140)

---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This release drops support for dbt versions below 1.3.** In order to support the new dbt-utils major release, we need to drop support for dbt versions below 1.3. As a result, we've stopped using macros from dbt-utils which removes the deprecation warnings users were seeing.
