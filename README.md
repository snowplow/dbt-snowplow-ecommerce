# Snowplow E-Commerce

This dbt package:

- Transforms and aggregates raw web e-commerce event data collected from the [Snowplow JavaScript tracker][tracker-docs] into a set of derived tables based around the following e-commerce data objects: carts, checkouts, products and transactions.
- Processes **all e-commerce events incrementally**. It is not just constrained to out-of-the-box events - any custom events you are tracking will also be incrementally processed.
- Is designed in a modular manner, allowing you to easily integrate your own custom SQL into the incremental framework provided by the package.

Please refer to the [doc site][snowplow-ecommerce-docs] for a full breakdown of the package.

### Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to follow our [QuickStart guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-quickstart/ecommerce/), or to use our [E-Commerce Web Accelerator](https://docs.snowplow.io/accelerators/ecommerce/) which includes steps for setting up tracking as well as modeling.

### Adapter Support

The latest version of the snowplow-ecommerce package supports BigQuery, Databricks, and Snowflake. For previous versions see our [package docs](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/).

### Requirements

- A dataset of web events from the [Snowplow JavaScript tracker][tracker-docs] must be available in the database.
- Have the [`webPage` context][webpage-context] enabled.
